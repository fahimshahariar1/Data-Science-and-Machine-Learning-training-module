Topics Covered: 

1. Data:
    * Numerical / Quantitative
    * Categorical / Qualititative

  Numerical Data:
      * Discrete --> Any whole number (1, 2, 3)
      * Contunuous --> Any value within a specified range (CGPA, Height)

  Categorical:
      * Atribute / Dichtomous --> Values that has two categories (yes/no, dead/alive)
      * Nominal --> Can not be ordered in any way (hair color)
      * Ordinal --> Can be ordered (class roles)

2. Cumulative Frequency Table: In Statistics, a cumulative frequency is defined as the total of frequencies, that are distributed over different class intervals. 
    It means that the data and the total are represented in the form of a table in which the frequencies are distributed according to the class interval

3. Mean: The sum of all values divided by number of values
4. Median: The middle value when the values are arranged in an order
5. Median: THe most commonly ocuring value

6. Variance: a statistical measurement of the spread between numbers in a data set.
7. Standard Deviation: Square root of variance.
