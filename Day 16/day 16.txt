Topics Covered:

Python Basics:
Equality and Boolean statements: using comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=) and logical operators (and, or, not).

Data types: numbers (integers, floats), strings, lists.

Input and output: using the input() function to get user input and the print() function to display output.

Control flow: using if-else statements for conditional execution.

Loops: using for and while loops for repetitive tasks.

List operations: accessing elements, modifying elements, adding and removing elements.

Key Points:
Understand how to use comparison operators and logical operators to create Boolean expressions.
Work with different data types in Python.
Use input and output functions to interact with the user.
Control program flow using if-else statements and loops.
Manipulate lists effectively.
