Topics Covered:

Basic Python Syntax:
Variables: Containers for storing data values.
Arithmetic operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
Data types: Numbers (integers, floats, complex numbers), strings, lists, booleans.
  
Control Flow:
Conditional statements (if, else, elif).
Loops (for, while).
  
Functions:
Reusable blocks of code.
Defined using the def keyword.
Can take arguments and return values.
  
Data Structures:
Lists: Ordered collections of items.
Tuples: Immutable ordered collections of items.
Dictionaries: Unordered collections of key-value pairs.
  
Statistical Concepts:
Factorial design: Experimental design technique.
Split plot design: Experimental design technique.
Significance level: Probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis.

  
Key Points:
Understand basic Python syntax for variables, arithmetic operations, and data types.
Learn about control flow statements (if, else, elif, for, while).
Create and use functions in Python.
Explore different data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries).
Understand basic statistical concepts (factorial design, split plot design, significance level).
