Data Transformation

Data transformation is a process of changing the data to make it more suitable for analysis.
One reason for data transformation is to linearize the relationship between variables.
Another reason for data transformation is to make the data more normally distributed.
Common data transformations include:
Log transformation
Square root transformation
Cube root transformation
Reciprocal transformation
The choice of data transformation depends on the specific data set and the desired outcome.
Example 1: Car Braking Distance

The data set contains information about the speed of a car and the distance it takes to stop.
The relationship between speed and stopping distance is not linear.
Taking the square root of the stopping distance linearizes the relationship.
Example 2: Blood Pressure

The data set contains information about the blood pressure, weight, and age of a group of males.
The relationship between blood pressure and weight and age is linear.
The estimated regression equation is:
Blood pressure = -65.1 + 1.08 * weight + 0.425 * age
This equation means that for every one unit increase in weight, blood pressure increases by 1.08 units, holding age constant.
Similarly, for every one unit increase in age, blood pressure increases by 0.425 units, holding weight constant.
Model Assessment

The estimated regression coefficients and their standard errors are:
Intercept: -65.1 ± 25.09
Weight: 1.08 ± 1.77
Age: 0.425 ± 0.95
The R-squared value is 0.958, which means that 95.8% of the variability in blood pressure is explained by weight and age.
The residuals are the difference between the actual blood pressure and the predicted blood pressure.
The residuals should be normally distributed with a mean of zero and constant variance.
The residuals can be plotted against the predicted values to check for any patterns.
Conclusion

Data transformation is an important step in data analysis.
It can be used to linearize relationships and make data more normally distributed.
The choice of data transformation depends on the specific data set and the desired outcome.
Model assessment is important to ensure that the model is a good fit for the data.
