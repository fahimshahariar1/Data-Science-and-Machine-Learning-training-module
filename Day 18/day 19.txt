Arithmetic assignment (+=, -=, *=, /=, %=): Performs an arithmetic operation and assigns the result to the variable.

Comparison Operators:
Equal to (==), not equal to (!=), greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal to (>=), less than or equal to (<=).

Logical Operators:
And (and), or (or), not (not).
  
Membership Operators:
In (in), not in (not in).

Identity Operators:
Is (is), is not (is not).   

Conditional Statements:
If-else statements.
Nested if-else statements.

Loops:
For loops.
While loops.


Key Points:
Understand different types of assignment operators.
Use comparison operators to compare values.
Combine conditions using logical operators.
Check for membership in sequences using membership operators.
Compare object identities using identity operators.
Make decisions using conditional statements.
Create loops for repetitive tasks.
