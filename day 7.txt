Here are the key points covered in the video along with step-by-step bullet points:

Exploratory Data Analysis [EDA]

EDA is a technique to understand the data by summarizing the data and identifying patterns and trends.
Basic Statistics

There are three main types of measures of central tendency: mean, median, and mode.

Mean: The average of a set of numbers. It is calculated by adding all the numbers and then dividing by the number of numbers.
Median: The middle value when the numbers are listed in order from smallest to largest. If there are two middle numbers, the median is the mean of those two numbers.
Mode: The most frequent value in a set of numbers.
There are two measures of dispersion: variance and standard deviation.

Variance: The average of the squared deviations from the mean.
Standard deviation: The square root of the variance.
Correlation coefficient: It is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables. It can be positive, negative, or zero.

Positive correlation: As the value of one variable increases, the value of the other variable also increases.
Negative correlation: As the value of one variable increases, the value of the other variable decreases.
Zero correlation: There is no linear relationship between the two variables.
Linear Regression

It is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
The equation for a simple linear regression model is: Y = β₀ + β₁X + ε
Y is the dependent variable.
X is the independent variable.
β₀ is the y-intercept.
β₁ is the slope of the regression line.
ε is the error term.
