Topics Covered:

Power over any number. It can be both positive and Negative.
        Laws of Power:
                1. Multiplying power: 2^4 * 2^3 = 2^4+3 [in case of multiplication the powers will be added together if the variables are the same]
                2. Division of power: 2^4 / 2^3 = 2^4-3 [in case of division the powers will be subtracted from each other if the variables are the same]
                3. Raising to the power: (2^4)^3 = 2^4*3 [in case of raising to the power the powers will be multiplied together]
                4. Negative power: 4^-1 = 1/4 [in case of negative power the variables will switch places as numerator and denominator]

Algebraic Equation:

        2x + 22 = x + 1

        ⇒ 2x + 22 = x + 1

        ⇒ 2x – x = –22 + 1

        ⇒ x = –21

Equation of Straight Line: ax+by = c
        

Quadratic Equation: x = -b +- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) / 2a
        
        2x2 – 5x + 3 = 0

        2x2 – 2x-3x+3 = 0

        2x(x-1)-3(x-1) = 0

        (2x-3) (x-1) = 0

        So,

        2x-3 = 0; x = 3/2

        (x-1) = 0; x=1


Parabolae: y = mx + k

Logarithm: Addition:

Logarithms of products can be expressed as the sum of the logarithms of the individual factors, provided the logarithms have the same base. Here's the formula:

log_a(b x c) = log_a(b) + log_a(c)

where:

a is the base of the logarithm (a > 0, a ≠ 1)
b and c are any positive numbers
Example:

log_5(25 x 3) = log_5(25) + log_5(3)

Multiplication:

The logarithm of a power can be expressed as the product of the exponent and the logarithm of the base. Here's the formula:

log_a(b^n) = n * log_a(b)

where:

a is the base of the logarithm (a > 0, a ≠ 1)
b is any positive number
n is any real number
Example:

log_2(16) = 4 * log_2(2)

Division:

The logarithm of a quotient can be expressed as the difference of the logarithms of the numerator and denominator, provided the logarithms have the same base. Here's the formula:

log_a(b / c) = log_a(b) - log_a(c)

where:

a is the base of the logarithm (a > 0, a ≠ 1)
b and c are any positive numbers, and b ≠ 0
Example:

log_3(9 / 1) = log_3(9) - log_3(1)

Power:

This property is essentially the same as the multiplication property, but it applies when the argument of the logarithm (the number being logged) is itself an exponential term. Here's the formula:

log_a(b^(m^n)) = (m^n) * log_a(b)

where:

a is the base of the logarithm (a > 0, a ≠ 1)
b is any positive number
m and n are any real numbers
Example:

log_10(100^(1/2)) = (1/2) * log_10(100)
