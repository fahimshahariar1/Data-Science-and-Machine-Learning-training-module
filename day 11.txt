Topics Covered: 

1. Supervised vs. Unsupervised Machine Learning:
  Supervised machine learning involves training a model on labeled data to make predictions.
  Unsupervised machine learning involves finding patterns in unlabeled data.
    
2. Distribution Estimation:
    Involves estimating the probability distribution of data.
    Can be used for classification, regression, and anomaly detection.

3. Finding Associations:
    Involves finding relationships between variables in data.
    Can be used for market basket analysis and recommendation systems.

4. Software for Machine Learning:
    Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):
    Provide tools for writing and running code.
    Examples: PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, RStudio.

5. Machine Learning Libraries:
    Provide pre-built algorithms and functions.
    Examples: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras.

6. Cloud-based platforms:
    Provide access to computing resources and machine learning tools.
    Examples: Google Colab, Amazon SageMaker, Azure Machine Learning.

Understand the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning.
Learn about distribution estimation and finding associations.
Explore different software options for machine learning.
Consider hardware requirements for running machine learning models.
